## Exercise 1 - Gender detection of names
In NLTK you'll find the corpus `corpus.names`. A set of 5000 male and 3000 female names.
1) Select a ratio of train/test data (based on experiences from previous labs perhaps?)
2) Build a feature extractor function
3) Build two classifiers:
    - Decision tree
    - Na√Øve bayes
    
Finally, write code to evaluate the classifiers. Explain your results, and what do you think would change if you altered your feature extractor?
